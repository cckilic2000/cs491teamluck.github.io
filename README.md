## Project Description

Our project aims to feed a large quantity of data in MIDI format to our algorithm and produce a melody similar to the inputs given to the program. For example, we will transform all of Mozart's music into MIDI files, analyze the patterns within the compositions, and produce a piece that will sound like Mozart has produced it. Examples of attributes that will be analyzed will be the scale used in which the piece was written, the key of the piece, the tone of the piece, the tempo of the piece, etc. Mainly the idea will be to analyze the piece through different musical attributes and offer a way to create a similar piece while manipulating the wanted parameters. For example, The user wants a melody with 120 bpm in the B key that has been written in B# major that is reminiscent of Mozart. Our program will analyze the MIDI files that exist in the database under the name of Mozart and will produce a similar melody to the pieces chosen by him.
